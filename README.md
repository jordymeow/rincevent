# Rincevent
Rincevent is a software that allows you to learn in a non-monotonous manner, all day long, wherever you are. Learn vocabulary, a foreign language, mathematical formulas, the names of monuments (with images), musical notes (with sound). You can learn all the day long with a small pop-up window that regularly appears on your screen, and later, to learn more intensively in multiple choice mode.

# Vocabulary
It is easy to create lists, import new words from CSV files, but you can also use the lists I have already made. They are available in the Vocabulary directory and they mainly target Japanese, Chinese and English. There is also a list for guitar chords.

# Made in... 2009 ;)
This software was made in 2009 and was never updated since then. It still work on Windows (and Windows only) and has an interesting concept (much better than Anki in my opinion), supports plugins and so on. It would be awesome to see it improved by the community somehow or to see an OSX version of it. Please check the GitHub's wiki about this project to learn more.
