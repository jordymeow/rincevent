# Rincevent
Rincevent is a software that allows you to learn in a non-monotonous manner, all day long, wherever you are. Learn vocabulary, a foreign language, mathematical formulas, the names of monuments (with images), musical notes (with sound). You can learn all the day long with a small pop-up window that regularly appears on your screen, and later, to learn more intensively in multiple choice mode.

# Made in 2009
This software was made in 2009 and was never updated since then. It probably still work on Windows (and Windows only) and has an interesting concept (much better than Anki in my opinion), supports plugins and so on. It would be awesome to see it improved by the community somehow or to see an OSX version of it.
